library(querychat) # AI chatbot connection
library(leaflet) # pretty mapping
library(tidyverse) # for everything
library(DT) # table work
library(sf) # for the maps
library(tigris) # more mapping
library(htmltools) # to make the whole thing run via html
library(plotly) # for interactive plots
library(janitor) # to clean up
library(stringi) # to fix some strings
